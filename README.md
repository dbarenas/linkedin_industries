linkedin_industries
===================

A list of LinkedIn industries, in various formats.

The LinkedIn API does not appear to provide an endpoint for retrieving a complete list of industries that appear in job entries. If you want such a list for your app, you'll need to keep it handy in your local codebase. So here ya go.

`linkedin_industries.csv` is manually copy/pasted from [LinkedIn's official list](http://developer.linkedin.com/documents/industry-codes) and then exported to JSON, YAML, and Ruby source. Yeah, it'd be better to automate the data-scraping, but I'm led to believe that the content doesn't change all that often.

The most recent version of this list is [available on Github](https://github.com/jeffomatic/linkedin_industries). If you have updates, please send a pull request my way.
